	<h1>BOUNCE<br>TRAMPOLINE<br>PARK</h1>
	<p id="slogan">Fly through the air and bounce off the walls</p>
	<p>BOUNCE is a world where the wall becomes the floor, a slam dunk is within your grasp and the rules of gravity no longer apply. It's packed with lots of things to do with kids and the family, it takes the rush of getting airborne and adds a bunch of new dimensions - from aerial manoeuvres to slam dunking, wall running and Dodgeball warfare.</p>

	<p>The best part is it doesn't matter if you're under 5 or an action sports junkie in training - you're never too old or too young to have an awesome time. With more than 100 interconnected trampolines housed within huge, colourful spaces at a growing number of locations around the world, BOUNCE is a spring-loaded urban playground with a wide range of things to do with kids; where hard surfaces are replaced with circus-grade sponge, giant air bags and springs.</p>
