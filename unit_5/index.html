        <h2>The Wall</h2>
        <h3>Bounce off the walls - literally</h3>
        <p>The Wall steps things up to the next level. It’s our most awesome feature – kind of like a half pipe made out of trampolines. You probably need to see it, live or check out the video to get what we’re talking about, but like all the best ideas it’s a super simple concept – use the high-rebound capabilities of Performance Trampolines and run up The Wall.</p>
        <br>
		<p>Pioneered in the Cirque Du Soleil, Wall Running is a new art form that takes a few tips to master, but it’s also a lot easier than it looks. Sort of like riding a bike, if riding a bike felt like skydiving backwards. Come and have a crack at the next frontier of the Free-Jumping Revolution! Be a Wall Runner.</p>

        <h2>Free-Jumping Arena</h2>
        <h3>Get airborne</h3>
        <p>The Free-Jumping Arena is BOUNCE’s main stage – with over 50 interconnected trampolines incorporating a series of longer tumble tracks and angled banked walls.</p>
        <br>
		<p>String together jumping lines as you leap from tramp to tramp and rebound off the corners. Work on your own routine or just run wild around the oversized playground. It’s like parkour made soft, safe and easy. Get Airborne in the Free Jumping Arena next time you head down for a jump at BOUNCE.</p>

        <h2>Big Bag</h2>
        <h3>Master your moves</h3>
        <p>The Big Bag provides a massive soft landing spot for your aerial endeavours. It’s also a great place to work on moves that you can take to the Performance Trampolines, the street or the slopes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lying at the end of a rebound tumble track, the giant inflatable bag sits in a five-foot-deep pit. Start with simple jumps then get as technical as you like.</p>
